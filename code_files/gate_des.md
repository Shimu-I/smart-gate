This program is written for an **ESP32-S3 microcontroller** that uses an **Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID module** over **I2C** communication.

It detects RFID cards and prints their **unique identifier (UID)** to the **Serial Monitor**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Include necessary libraries

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_PN532.h>

```

- `Wire.h` â†’ enables I2C communication (used to talk to the PN532 chip).
- `Adafruit_PN532.h` â†’ Adafruitâ€™s official library for handling PN532 RFID/NFC module functions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Define I2C pins

```cpp
#define SDA_PIN 21
#define SCL_PIN 17

```

- Defines which pins of the ESP32-S3 will be used for I2C communication:
    - **SDA (Serial Data Line)** = 21
    - **SCL (Serial Clock Line)** = 17

Different ESP32 boards can have different pin mappings â€” so this tells the program which ones to use.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Create PN532 instance

```cpp
Adafruit_PN532 nfc(SDA_PIN, SCL_PIN);

```

- This creates an object named `nfc` to control the PN532.
- It tells the library to use I2C with the pins defined above.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Setup function

The `setup()` function runs **once** when the device starts.

### a) Start Serial Monitor

```cpp
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println("Initializing PN532 RFID reader (I2C mode)...");

```

- Initializes serial communication at **9600 bps** so you can see messages on your computer.
- Prints a status message.

---

### b) Initialize I2C communication

```cpp
Wire.begin(SDA_PIN, SCL_PIN);

```

- Starts the I2C bus with the chosen pins.
- Without this, the ESP32 wonâ€™t be able to communicate with the PN532.

---

### c) Initialize PN532 module

```cpp
nfc.begin();

```

- Initializes the PN532 hardware and prepares it for commands.

---

### d) Check if PN532 is detected

```cpp
uint32_t versiondata = nfc.getFirmwareVersion();
if (!versiondata) {
  Serial.println("Didn't find PN532 chip. Check wiring or I2C mode jumpers.");
  while (1);
}

```

- Sends a command to the PN532 asking for its firmware version.
- If it doesnâ€™t respond (`versiondata == 0`), the program stops (`while(1)` freezes it) and prints an error message.
- This helps confirm that the module is connected and working.

---

### e) Print firmware info

```cpp
Serial.print("Found PN532 chip with firmware version: ");
Serial.print((versiondata >> 16) & 0xFF, DEC);
Serial.print('.');
Serial.println((versiondata >> 8) & 0xFF, DEC);

```

- The firmware version is encoded in a 32-bit number.
- Bit shifting (`>>`) extracts the versionâ€™s **major** and **minor** parts:
    - `(versiondata >> 16) & 0xFF` â†’ major version
    - `(versiondata >> 8) & 0xFF` â†’ minor version
- Prints something like:
    
    `Found PN532 chip with firmware version: 1.6`
    

---

### f) Configure PN532 for reading RFID cards

```cpp
nfc.SAMConfig();

```

- Configures the PN532â€™s **SAM (Secure Access Module)** mode so it can read passive RFID/NFC tags.
- Itâ€™s required before calling `readPassiveTargetID()`.

---

### g) Ready message

```cpp
Serial.println("PN532 ready! Tap an RFID card...");
Serial.println("--------------------------------------");

```

- Prints a message indicating that everything is ready.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Loop function

The `loop()` function runs **continuously** after setup.

### a) Declare variables

```cpp
uint8_t success;
uint8_t uid[7];
uint8_t uidLength;

```

- `success`: indicates whether a card was detected.
- `uid`: array to store the cardâ€™s **unique ID** (up to 7 bytes long).
- `uidLength`: actual length of the UID (some cards use 4 bytes, some 7).

---

### b) Check for RFID card

```cpp
success = nfc.readPassiveTargetID(PN532_MIFARE_ISO14443A, uid, &uidLength);

```

- The PN532 listens for **MIFARE / ISO14443A** RFID tags.
- If a card is detected:
    - `success` = `1` (true)
    - `uid` contains the cardâ€™s ID bytes
    - `uidLength` tells how many bytes the ID has

If no card is present, `success = 0`.

---

### c) If a card is detected, print its UID

```cpp
if (success) {
  Serial.print("RFID Card Detected! UID: ");
  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < uidLength; i++) {
    if (uid[i] < 0x10) Serial.print("0");
    Serial.print(uid[i], HEX);
    Serial.print(" ");
  }
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("--------------------------------------");

  delay(2000);
}

```

- Loops through each byte in the UID and prints it in **hexadecimal** format.
- Adds a leading `0` for single-digit bytes (for consistent formatting).
- Example output:
    
    ```
    RFID Card Detected! UID: 04 A3 B2 6F
    --------------------------------------
    
    ```
    
- Waits **2 seconds** before scanning again (`delay(2000)`), to avoid reading the same card multiple times rapidly.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary of Program Flow

1. Setup serial and I2C communication.
2. Initialize PN532 and check if itâ€™s working.
3. Configure PN532 for RFID tag detection.
4. Continuously check for cards in the loop.
5. When a card is found, print its UID to the serial monitor.
